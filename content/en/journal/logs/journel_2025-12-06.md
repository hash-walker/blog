# What did I work on today?
- I worked literally on nothing today
# What did I learn today?

- **Topic:** Containers vs VM's (Book: Using docker by Adrian Mouat)
- The **Why**: Solves "it works on my machine." Containers bundle app + libs (user space) but share the Host Kernel.   
- **Key Architecture Difference:**
    - **VM's:** Hardware → HostOS → Hypervisor → GuestOS(heavy) → App
    - **Containers:** Hardware → HostOS → Container Engine → No GuestOS (light) → App
- **Performance:** VM calls are expensive (Guest Kernel → Hypervisor → Host Kernel → Hardware), Containers run as native processes on HostOS, making it's startup fast.

# Any blockers?
- I wake up late
- didn't offer some of my prayers
