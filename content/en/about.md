**Hello! I'm Hamza Faraz.**

I am a Computer Science student at **Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology (GIKI)**, Class of 2026. I am passionate about **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**, **Golang**, and building systems that scale.

> *"Optimizing myself till now."*

I enjoy solving complex problems and working on meaningful projects that have real-world impact. Whether it's building a transport management system for my university or optimizing AI integrations for a SaaS platform, I love the process of turning ideas into efficient, working software.

When I'm not coding, I'm likely exploring new tech, leading student clubs, or mentoring others in programming.

## Experience & Projects
*   **Software Engineer @ GIKI:** Developed a transport management system used by 3,000+ students and employees, streamlining ticket bookings and revenue tracking.
*   **Intern @ Techloyce - SubscriptionFlow:** Enhanced frontend performance, built end-to-end tests, and worked on AI/ML models for business insights.
*   **RSS Aggregator:** Built a full-stack web app with Golang and React to aggregate and manage blog feeds efficiently.
*   **Microsoft Club-GIKI:** Serving as President, I lead initiatives to foster a tech culture on campus.

## Technical Skills
*   **Languages:** Golang, Python, JavaScript, C++, SQL
*   **Tools & Frameworks:** React, Node.js, Docker, Git, PostgreSQL, VS Code, Linux
