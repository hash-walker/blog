**Hello! I'm Hamza Faraz.**

I am a Computer Science student at **Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology (GIKI)**, Class of 2026. I am passionate about **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**, **Golang**, and building systems that scale.

> *"Optimizing myself till now."*

I enjoy solving complex problems and working on meaningful projects that have real-world impact. Whether it's building a transport management system for my university or optimizing AI integrations for a SaaS platform, I love the process of turning ideas into efficient, working software.

When I'm not coding, I'm likely exploring new tech, leading student clubs, or mentoring others in programming.

*   **RSS Aggregator:** Built a full-stack web app with Golang and React to aggregate and manage blog feeds efficiently.
